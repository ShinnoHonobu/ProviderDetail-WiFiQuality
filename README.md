## Why we need to Analyze?
Analyzing mobile network providers and WiFi quality is crucial for ensuring a stable, fast, and reliable connection in different locations. Here’s why it matters:

**1. Ensuring Good Mobile Network Connectivity**
- Better Call Quality & Data Speed → Identifying which provider offers the best signal strength (RSSI, RSRP, RSRQ, SINR) for smoother calls and faster internet.
- Coverage Optimization → Helps users decide which provider works best in a specific area (home, office, or outdoors).
- Troubleshooting Connectivity Issues → Finding weak signal zones to improve mobile network coverage
  
**2️. Improving WiFi Performance**
- Better Internet Speed & Stability → Analyzing WiFi signal strength (dBm), latency, and congestion to ensure a smooth browsing and streaming experience.
- Reducing Interference → Identifying overlapping WiFi channels and switching to a less congested one for better performance.
- Optimizing Router Placement → Finding the best location for a WiFi router to maximize coverage and minimize dead zones.
  
**3️. Helping in Decision-Making**
- Choosing the Best Mobile Provider → Based on signal strength and reliability in a specific area.
- Upgrading or Changing ISP (Internet Service Provider) → If WiFi performance is poor, users can decide whether to upgrade their plan or switch ISPs.
- Planning for Businesses & Smart Homes → Ensuring strong connectivity for offices, IoT devices, and smart home systems.
  
**4️. Supporting Network Engineers & IT Professionals**
- Network Troubleshooting → Helps IT teams diagnose connectivity issues efficiently.
- Optimizing Public WiFi Networks → Useful for organizations providing public WiFi (cafes, malls, airports).
- Data-Driven Network Expansion → Helps telecom companies identify areas needing better coverage.

## Tools used for Analyzing

Here, we use 3 tools to help us to analyze the provider's detail and WiFi's quality, which are :

**- Network Cell Info**, to know to detail's of provider used

**- CellMap**, to know the location of BTS Tower of the provider

**- Wifi Analyzer**, to know the used WiFi's strength
